Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's \u00e4 2 standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 3
when an \u00e4 unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 4
It has survived not only five centuries, 5 but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 6
remaining essentially unchanged. 7 It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 8 and more recently with desktop publishing software like
Aldus PageMaker \u00e4 including versions of Lorem Ipsum. 9
